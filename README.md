# randimg

A web service that displays a random image, made primarily to show random pictures of [Bl√•haj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bl%C3%A5haj) on my website [kaesebrot.eu/blahaj](https://kaesebrot.eu/blahaj) :)

</p>

## Features
- [x] on-the-fly cached image generation for different resolutions
- [x] deterministic image IDs that are calculated from the pixel values, not the file bytes: an image will always receive the same ID
- [x] privacy-focused: all EXIF tags are stripped from hosted images
- [x] [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/) integration for link previews
- [x] [inotify](https://linux.die.net/man/7/inotify)-based watchfolder support: images are automatically added/removed when copied/deleted to/from the input folder
- [ ] optimized slim page responses for crawlers (return just Open Graph tags and the html header)
- [ ] gallery page
- [ ] pageable image API
- [ ] responsive page UI with focus on mobile usage
- [ ] as few HTML/CSS/Javascript dependencies as possible

## Deployment
The service is available as a container on Docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/daskaesebrot/randimg
```bash
docker pull daskaesebrot/randimg
```
